Here are some things that you (a software engineer) can do to help your team.

## Anticipate failure

## Suggest alternatives
"How long would feature X take?"

"Feature X might take me 10 months"

"That's too long! Crap!!"

"I can build Feature Y in 2 weeks. It's accomplishes something similar to Feature X. Would that work?"

"Oh, that's good enough!"

## Write documentation
At some point a new person will pick up things you worked on. You may or may not be around. 
- What information that's in your brain will the new person wish was written down? 
- What information did you wish was written down when you started?

## Break down large tasks

## Provide estimates
- We found tiny user-facing bug! 
Will it take one day to fix? 
Or 2 months because it requires refactoring a lot of existing code. 

## Find workarounds




## Setup infrastructure



## Unblock work

## Automate tasks
"I did this by hand 3 times in the last week."
- What if you wrote a script to make it easier for the next time?

## Architect a system

## Maintain reliability

## Build new features

## Pay off tech debt

## Evaluate & Communicate tradeoffs

## Mentor others

## Find and attract new talent
